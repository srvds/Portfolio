# Data Science Portfolio


In this repository, I have put some of the Data science projects, I have worked on or currently working. 
All the projects will mostly focus on utilizing Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques to design data science or statistical models, that either solves a problem or discovers important information about the data.

## NOTE:
* I am in the process of Documenting Source of Datasets and how to reproduce results and much more for each project
* Most of it can also be found in the respective Jupyter notebooks even if the .MD files are not yet updated

Click on the projects to see the documentation and code.(being build,meanwhile check the ipython notebooks)

## Projects:

###  [Human Activity Recognition](https://github.com/srvds/Human-Activity-Recognition)
* Predicts the human activities
* Accelerometer and Gyroscope readings with smart phone straped to the waist while performing the following 6 Activities.
| 1. Walking | 2. WalkingUpstairs | 3. WalkingDownstairs | 4. Standing | 5. Sitting | 6. Lying
* Modeled as a 6 class classification problem.
* The raw data is featurized with the help of Domain expert.
* The Classical Machine Learning Algorithms were trained on the featured data and tuned with Grid Search CV
* The LSTM model was trained on Raw data to compare the results. This truely demonstrates the power of deep learning.
* **t-sne Visualization**
